Algorithm Selection Library

# Introduction

The problem of algorithm selection is attracting increasing attention from researchers and practitioners from a variety of different backgrounds. After years of fruitful applications in a number of domains, a lot of data has been generated, but the community lacks a standard format or repository for this data. This situation makes it difficult to effectively share and compare different approaches, in contrast with other, more established fields. It also unnecessarily hinders new researchers seeking to begin work in this area.

We present a standardized format for representing algorithm selection scenarios and an algorithm selection library, ASlib, that contains a growing number of data sets from the literature. Our format has been designed to be able to express a wide variety of different scenarios.

The ASlib consists of algorithm selection scenarios from a many different domains, such as SAT, CSP, ASP and more. For the formal definition of the format, please see [aslib.net](http://www.aslib.net/).
